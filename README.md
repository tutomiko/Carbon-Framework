## Overview

## Goals
The goal for the project is to have a powerful cross-platform, pure-C library that allows for quick and efficient C development 
without additional dependencies.

## Getting Started
To add Fireworks to your project, simply download the project, open the Visual Studio solution file and build the static library. <p>
To link the static library to your project:
```c
#pragma comment(lib, "Fireworks Framework-x86.lib")
```

To include the primary header:
```c
#include <fireworks.h>
```

## Dependencies
As mentioned prior, 
Fireworks is in itself dependent only on standard C-libraries and platform-specific libraries (e.g. kernel32.dll on MS-Windows platforms) 
so it's ready for out-of-the-box deployment.

## Examples
```c
int main(){

}
```

## Issues
Time.<p>
Time is the main issue. 
The project is currently being maintained by just me, so the development is slow and any bug fixes or feature implementations may take a while.

## Help Wanted
All who wish to pitch in on development of the project are more than welcome!<p>

## Donate
Feel free to donate to support the development of the library<p>
